              <h3>What We Do</h3>
              <p>Love love love... We are a bit different to other charter yacht brokers. The crew of Paradise Connections live in the Caribbean islands year round aboard our personal sail boat. We keep in touch with the boats and crews as they are our friends and neighbors.</p>
